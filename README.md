### imp-re engine

It's a relatively simple C++ engine for personal purposes.

It uses SDL2 for window management, OpenGL for graphics, and OpenAL for audio.

It also comes with custom macro-based relfection, custom JSON parser and several other features.

It's licensed under **ZLIB license**, so feel free to use it.
